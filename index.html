<p class="mainp"><strong>We cater to clients who want our bikes.</strong> Most are passionate about biking and see it as part of a lifestyle. This might mean they are competitive, like to style their vehicles, incorporate biking into their daily lives for transportation or may just be a weekend warrior. Many members visit the site to place orders and to see the new stock. Our customers know bikes so they don't need large detailed descriptions about each product but they might be interested in the specs. They just need to see the name, price and image of the product. We are a business-to-customer organization (B2C). Requirements We want a site where customers can explore new bikes and add-ons that inspire and excite them. We want the world to see how fantastic these machines are. The bikes are the main attraction of this Website and everything should be designed around that. The Website should convey: style, quality, power/speed, and freedom.</p>

<p class="mainp"><strong>We don’t just customize bikes.</strong> We also sell stuff we know you’ll dig. Riding is a lifestyle, and we want to help you live your life. You pick the brand(s) that Vicious carries.</p>

<p class="mainp">When it comes to industry leading innovations in cycles and accessories, Vicious Cycle products are what you have been waiting for. We sell top quality cycling equipment and have been doing it for years. Our products have become the supply line of choice and lesser companies have been copying us for some time. Don't be fooled by imitators, Vicious Cycles is the real deal. Don't settle for second best when it comes to your cycling needs, but don't feel you have to raid your savings. Vicious Cycle Products is a name you can put your trust into, at a price you can afford. Of course, Custom Work is another thing entirely. At Vicious Cycles, we are not interested in a "Race to the Bottom" when it comes to creating custom builds. If you're interested in discussing a fully-custom or customized build, come down to our store and visit with us to find out what we can really do.</p>
